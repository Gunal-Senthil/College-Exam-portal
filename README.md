# College-Exam-portal
A college exam portal designed using HTML and CSS provides a structured and visually appealing interface for students and faculty to manage and take exams. HTML is used to create the foundational layout of the portal, including sections for exam schedules, instructions, and input fields for student answers. CSS enhances the user experience by styling these elements, ensuring a clean and intuitive interface that is easy to navigate. This combination allows for a responsive and accessible platform where users can efficiently interact with exam materials and submit their responses, contributing to a streamlined and effective examination process.
